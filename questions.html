							<h1>Questions</h1>
							<h2>How does one join the EIC?</h2>
							<p>We're glad to hear that you're interested! To join, head over to our membership page <a href="membership.html">here</a> to find all the information pertaining to what we value as well as the application form. Once you have filled out the form, we will get back to you via email about your application in a few days.</p>
							<h2>What communication platform is prodominantly used for the club?</h2>
							<p>We mainly use Discord to communicate between the various projects, their respectful subteams, and the club as a whole. If you don't know what Discord is or would like to learn more about the platform, click <a href="https://discord.com/">here</a> to be redirected to their site. Discord is available on platforms such as Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and a few others. Once your application form has been filled out, we will be contacting you via email and will send you an invite link to our Discord server.</p>
							<h2>The name of the club has "Engineering" in it, is this an engineering focused club?</h2>
							<p>A key belief of the EIC is that we are willing to pursue various projects across various disciplines, which of course some of which may be engineering related. Being said, we strive to include as many people of diverse academic backgrounds as possible as it enables us to have plenty of doors opened for the future. We generally approach projects with intrinsic engineering principles in mind, but we are open to always trying out new things. If you'd like to propose a project non-engineering related or your background is of something else, we encourage you to still join!</p>
							<p>For context, nearly half of the total members of the club have backgrounds in fields such as industrial design, english, computer science, and a few others.</p>
							<h2>How involved do members have to be?</h2>
							<p>From when we originally thought up the concepts for the EIC, one thing we all agreed on from the start was having a club which was low commitment. We have seen that a lot of clubs require vast amounts of time and focus to be put towards them, and that many people found this very unappealing. With this, we have tried to ensure that the EIC has a more relaxed environment where we encourage the projects and people to go at their own pace. We don't want everything to be a race to the finish line after all.</p>
							<p>Though of course, we do require a little bit of commitment from each of our members, but we are more than willing to excuse any inactivity due to school or other, more important life matters.</p>
							<h2>Do you have to be a University of Alberta student?</h2>
							<p>Not at all! Infact, we have a few individuals from the University of British Columbia and even an alumni of the University of Alberta in the club at the moment. The Students' Union requires us to maintain 75% of membership being University of Alberta undergraduates but we still have plenty of the remaining 25% for non-University of Alberta students!</p>
							<h2>I have a question that isn't listed here.</h2>
							<p>Sorry to hear we couldn't answer it here, we try to have the most general questions we could get on this page. If you have any further questions, please refer to our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to contact us regarding your question.</p>
