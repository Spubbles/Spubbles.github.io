							<h1>Catapult Project: Phase 1</h1>
							<h2>About the Catapult Project: Phase 1</h2>
							<p>A catapult is one of the most iconic STEM projects. It demonstrates fundamental physics principles while introducing mechanical design to students. Catapults have been used for decades as a fun science project for all ages as a form of learning practical design skills. The general goal of a catapult is to convert stored potential energy into kinetic energy in order to launch a projectile towards a target. Optimal designs can aim to maximize distance, height or precision. </p>
							<p>The Engineering Innovation Club strives to add a modern twist by electronically controlling the trajectory of the catapult. Part I of the project involves the creation of small, cheap, table-top catapults designed for launching ping-pong balls into cups. Part II of the project will involve researching and designing a human sized ballista to launch a variety of projectiles with high accuracy.</p>
							<p>The main goal of the project is to allow students to collaborate together in an inclusive setting and enable students to gain valuable hands on experience through the design process. The catapult project employs intrinsic engineering principles while giving engineering students the opportunity to cultivate and grow their problem solving skills.</p>
							<h2>Background Information & History:</h2>
							<p>What if we made a catapult? That would be pretty cool right?</p>
							<p>What if we could pass a cold one to your bud 100m away? That is very cool.</p>
							<p>The catapult project was forged out of the wildest fantasy of every mechanical engineer: to create a gnarly catapult. EIC realized though this would take some work and jumping straight into a large project would be extremely difficult - so we did the next best thing. What if you could play beer pong with catapults? Or rather launching ping-pong balls into Red Solo Cups electronically via a mechanical launch mechanism. Phase I of the catapult project serves as a stepping stone to EIC's future projects while providing a fun and engaging way for students to have fun and apply their technical knowledge. The project tackles tricky design problems due to the various constraints which allows our members to have fun while still working hard and innovating new designs and technologies to meet the design problem.</p>
