							<h1>About the EIC</h1>
							<h2>What is the EIC?</h2>
							<p>The Engineering Innovation Club, or EIC, is a student group located at the University of Alberta with the goal of enabling students to create and innovate projects they come up with. We strive to facilitate projects that interest them and projects that they would not be able to do elsewhere, while accommodating student life. With this, we hold core values of: <b>innovation</b>, <b>creativity</b>, <b>ingenuity</b>, while upholding <b>engineering principles</b>.</p>
							<h2>History of the Club:</h2>
							<p>The concept of the EIC back in 2019 between our founders -- both of which were in first-year engineering. These early concepts would be expanded upon and discussed with various founding members throughout the next few months and would grow into the mold which would later become the EIC. From the beginning it was clear that many of the fellow clubs did not offer something which our founders felt students would want out of a club: low-commitment and focus on projects people want to do. Slowly, these ideals would be expanded upon and would build towards our core values as a club and how we want to guide ourselves.</p>
							<p>With the University of Alberta going online in March 2020 due to COVID-19, these discussions for a club would now brew even faster. Culminating into the unofficial EIC group with Edi: Discovery, our first project, which was chosen due to the pandemic.</p>
							<p>Development of Edi: Discovery would begin August 2020 and slowly go forward as we learnt the ins and outs of project management and how to run a group efficiently. Much of the early work on the game was conceptual and only very basic mechanics were implemented as we pushed to expand the clubs members.</p>
							<p>Come autumn of the same year, our executives would formalize the club at the University of Alberta and would register as a Students' Union and University of Alberta recognized student club -- a goal which we were striving for heavily over the months prior. Following us being formally recognized, we would run our first official election for the executive positions and would begin looking into starting up a second project under the club.</p>
							<p>During late 2020 and early 2021, the club would begin its second project: Catapult Project: Phase I, which was the first half of a conceptual project which many of our members wanted to do.</p>
